      "1  saturday november 8 2003 posted 0024 gmt  824 am hkt   cnn  former prisoner of war jessica lynch said that she believes the us military overdramatized the story of her rescue in iraq   lynch made those comments in an interview for abcs primetime to air tuesday the network released excerpts of the 90minute interview friday   but a senior us military official denied that the military ever exaggerated the rescue inaccuracies in reports of lynchs ordeal were the fault of the media which reported the story with incomplete information the official said   responding to questions that the military may have exaggerated the danger of her nighttime rescue from a nasiriya hospital by us commandos she said yeah i dont think it happened quite like that   however she also said that anyone in that kind of situation would obviously go in with force not knowing who was on the other side of the door   lynch 20 a former private first class from palestine west virginia who has since left the army said the way the military publicized her rescue also bothers her including the filming of it   it does bother me that they used me as a way to symbolize all this stuff she said its wrong   i dont know why they filmed it or why they say the things they say you know  all i know was that i was in that hospital hurting  i needed help i wanted out of there it didnt matter to me if they would have come in shirts and blank guns it wouldnt have mattered to me i wanted out of there   but lynch said she considers her rescuers my heroes im so thankful that they did what they did they risked their lives   lynch and 16 other soldiers from the 507th maintenance company were ambushed march 23 after taking a wrong turn under heavy fire the humvee in which lynch was riding crashed into a tractortrailer severely injuring her eleven soldiers died six including lynch were taken into custody   nine days later the smalltown private became a celebrity when us forces stormed the hospital and rescued her in what the military characterized at the time as a dangerous daring raid   subsequently the hospital staff said no iraqi troops were in the hospital at the time  and that they had unsuccessfully tried to turn lynch over to american forces earlier   a defense official said some media organizations had significantly inaccurate stories in the early days following the rescue while the military was still collecting the facts and assessing her condition   on sunday the rescue will be the subject of an nbc television movie saving jessica lynch   in her abc interview lynch also responded to the revelation in a new book about her ordeal that she may have been sexually assaulted during her captivity   she told abcs diane sawyer that she does not remember being raped and even just the thinking about that thats too painful she also said that she was not beaten during her captivity and that one nurse in the hospital even sang to her   the book i am a soldier too an authorized biography written by rick bragg cites a medical report that shows lynch was sexually assaulted   army officials would not comment on the account a spokesman said that federal privacy laws prevent the military from discussing hospital records that would contain such details   iraqi doctors who treated her after her capture disputed the claims of rape the associated press reported   dr mahdi khafazji an orthopedic surgeon at nasiriyahs main hospital who performed surgery on lynch to repair a fractured femur told the ap he found no signs that she was raped or sodomized full story   bragg resigned as a national correspondent for the new york times in may after the newspaper determined he had written a story for publication under his byline that had largely been reported by an unpaid uncredited freelancer bragg insisted that he was following newspaper policy and did nothing wrong   lying injured in the iraqi hospital lynch said she seriously thought i was going to be paralyzed for the rest of my life   ive never felt that much pain in my whole entire life it was you know from my foot to my other foot to my legs to my arms to my back my head   lynch told sawyer that she doesnt consider herself a hero i was just there in that spot you know the wrong place the wrong time   lynch and her fellow soldiers were tired hungry and werent thinking quickly when they made the wrong turn into an ambush she told sawyer during the confrontation with iraqi forces she said her rifle jammed and she did not fire a single round   she said it hurt her to learn that some news accounts of her capture said she had fired at iraqis until running out of ammunition and had suffered bullet and knife wounds in fact her injuries were the result of the humvee crash   it hurt in a way that people would make up stories that they had no truth about she said only i would have been able to know that because the other four people on my vehicle arent here to tell that story so i would have been the only one able to say  i went down shooting but i didnt   lynch said it may have been one of her fellow soldiers pvt lori piestewa who fought to her death   that may have been her but it wasnt me and im not taking credit for it lynch said   lynch told sawyer that she would like to get a college degree and become a kindergarten teacher but first she wants to complete physical therapy for her injuries   she said she still has no feeling in her left foot and walks with crutches and she continues to have kidney and bowel problems stemming from an injury to her spine   i just want to keep adding you know just steps every day just so eventually i can throw away the crutches and  just start walking on my own she said thats my goal i just want to be able to walk again   cnns

with instructions of commanding officers a representative of the usled coalition said thursday   its a new force and  we face some difficulties the representative said   in response to the resignations the coalition will review the terms and conditions and compare them with other security services in iraq  the police and civil defense corps the representative said   the first and only battalion of the new army serves under the us armys 4th infantry division    last month defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the pentagon and the coalition provisional authority were discussing recalling some units of the former iraqi army which was formally dissolved in may   the discussions followed a letter two senators sent president bush about the need to speed up the process by which iraqis assume greater responsibility for security as the coalition prepares to cede power back to iraqis in july   the letter from sens carl levin dmichigan and richard lugar rindiana said the new iraqi army which is being created from scratch currently has less than 1000 members we cannot afford to transfer security functions to iraqis at that slow a pace the quicker we get the new iraqi army in place the more security we are likely to have and the better off iraq will be   loud explosions rocked iraqs capital early friday near the headquarters of the coalition provisional authority   a military source said there were at least two explosions and that one of them hit inside the green zone where the usled coalition has its headquarters setting off warning sirens   the explosions could be rockets the source said earlier security experts working for cnn said the blasts sounded like mortars landing   a military source inside the green zone told cnn no injuries had been reported the source said all structures inside the compound seemed to be intact and said an initial assessment seemed to indicate the explosions happened just outside the compound   but the ferocity of the blasts had people working inside the headquarters diving under their desks sources said   the cpa headquarters was targeted in november in insurgent attacks but no one was injured   the green zone which sits on the west bank of the tigris river in the center of baghdad is the most heavily guarded site in the city   sharp international consternation greeted washingtons decision to bar opponents of the war from bidding on 186 billion worth of reconstruction projects the move has sparked fierce reactions from countries that didnt back the usled coalition such as russia germany and france   at a cabinet meeting thursday bush defended the decision saying american taxpayers want the contracts restricted to those countries that risked lives   the taxpayers understand why it makes sense for countries that risked lives to participate in the contracts in iraq it is very simple bush told reporters   our people risked their lives a friendly coalition risked their lives and therefore the contracting is going to reflect that and that is what the us taxpayers expect   in a written statement european union external affairs commissioner chris patten called the pentagon move extremely unhelpful   its not particularly constructive to dredge up these debates and divisions of the past patten said on the contrary its necessary to bring the willing together not divide them   un secretarygeneral kofi annan was also critical of the decision   since the war we are all trying to bring people together it is time to rebuild to work together to stabilize iraq annan said whatever initiative or actions or decisions should be unifying rather than divisive i would not characterize the decision taken yesterday as unifying   appearing at a news briefing with annan in berlin german chancellor gerhard schroeder said the reconstruction of iraq is a task for all people everyone and international law must apply   the flap over the contracts erupted wednesday as bush was calling on many of the leaders of the excluded nations to forgive billions of dollars in iraqi debts   bush said he asked french president jacques chirac russian president vladimir putin and schroeder to meet with former secretary of state james baker to discuss restructuring iraqs debt   white house officials said the contract policy came up in each of the telephone calls bush explained his stand and promised to keep the lines of communication open a spokesman said   but other us officials said the policy would change only if nations opposed to the war offered more financial and diplomatic support for postwar iraq  full
