0 this is my first time purchasing a mac and even using one i just got it delivered today and i am loving it so far its been pretty easy to use and ill see how well it works now that it has an m1 chip from apple in the following weeks
0 love the screen the movies look very nice my first time with a macbook and it is amazing
0 love it beautiful design super fast and everything i need in a laptop
0 coming from the 18 mb pro i was somewhat hesitate of downgrading to the mb air however i realized i didnt really use the features the pro was made for ex video editing touch bar etc i did my research and really wanted to see what this new m1 chip was all about im glad i did i traded in my pro for this beast and i havent regretted it one bit this air is fast and loads faster than my pro did the only thing ive noticed is the airs speakers are not as loud as the pros but im already use to it all in all im happy i traded it in the air is lightweight so easy to carry to class is not big so easily fits on tables and the new battery life is amazing ive had it unplugged and used it at my internship and all evening at home and im still at 80 all in all apple once again did amazing just a heads up i did store pickup and the m1 chip feature  any m1 wording is not on the box at all i was worried i didnt get the m1 edition until i got home and powered it on
0 its everything i expect from a laptop plus it gives me all of that with zero fan noise because theres no fan every app opens instantly the display is awesome and the battery life is the best around were really getting what we pay for with this ive been trying to figure out what device i want and kept exchanging laptops at best buy because i kept running into issues with build quality performance and speed with other laptop manufacturers im keeping this its everything i want and im finally happy with a laptop that meets my needs of what a laptop is supposed to do sure some might complain its only 8gb of ram but ive had no issues with performance and had many windows open at a time with all sorts of different programs i dont think saying oh its just 8gb of ram is a valid tech argument in the case with this laptop unless youre in a situation where you are multitasking while doing a production job that demands a high amount of ram dedicated to it at which point youre a professional and you know full well you should be using a highend desktop for such a usecase which due to cooling capabilities of desktops will beat out any current laptop on the market i myself have a desktop for such tasks and use it on occasion as needed plus i suspect you can just remote into your desktop from this macbook air if not now then when its soon supported to do the same work anyways the bottom line is this is a well built and well performing laptop that does what you want it to do and gives you what you would expect from a laptop of its caliber and class
0 this is such an amazing little laptop i am coming from windows 10 which is perfectly fine for desktoplaptop use but this latest update from apple is hands down the biggest leap in computing ive seen the battery life is beyond outstanding and is the most i have ever seen on a laptop no fans and no heat when doing heavy tasks unlike my old windows laptop which sounds like a jet taking off user experience is amazing for a beginner to mac os like me and i have had no issues getting everything set up the speed of this little laptop is by far better than anything ive ever used no long loading times no sluggish performance instant on etc im not very tech savy in the apple ecosystem but i can say that this little piece of hardware is an absolute game changer
0 love it everything is smooth and super fast on this macbook air so many things are improved by apples m1 processor  faster ssd readwrite speeds mean everything you do on your computer will feel faster this change drastically improves speed and battery life when setting up my air i was impressed by how quickly apps open and respond when you lift the lid the screen is instantly on now i spent an entire afternoon working on this computer at a cafe and was still at 80 battery when i left the reviewers are definitely right  for the majority of people needing a personal computer this is the computer to get in fact if your work applications are cloud based or not too heavy youd be good using this as your main work computer as well with the speed of this machine there are less reasons to go with the macbook pro now unless you do video editing all day or something similarly intensive im very impressed with this machine and happy i chose this mac
0 ive been using macs both desktop and laptop since the first intel macs in 2006 this is the 3rd macbook ive owned my previous two being a 2008 and 2015 macbook pro this macbook air is at another level and i understand that its a bit of a beta based on the fact its using the same design as its predecessor and still has to use emulation to run apps that have not been optimized for the m1 yet the responsiveness and battery life are extraordinary i have a 2018 ipad pro and apps on the air open just as quickly i believe its the best ultra portable laptop you can buy ive always considered apple products value buys even though they are expensive this air is definitely an amazing value when you compare the performance to much more expensive laptops i highly recommend
0 wish i could give this laptop 10 stars i had recently bought a surface 3 laptop literally just a day before the new mac m1 macbook air was announced i was still within my return period so i returned the surface and got the new mac im so glad i did everything about the new macbook air is amazing  no fan so its quiet all the time its super fast and the gold color is amazing thanks to best buy for the excellent return policy go get this computer you will not be disappointed
0 processing is excellent loved it i returned the computer after 2 days because the screen went blank i thought i had gotten the black screen of death the only way one could see what was happening was connecting my tv and using it as a monitor i called apple support after trying different commands with no success they told me to just return it to best buy and not use up my apple care i felt a little bad for the apple agents they were having a hard time since its a new processor i got another macbook air m1 lets see what happens with this one im sure i just got a lemon the irony my dinosaur 11 years old macbook pro ended up saving my day since my macbook air went blank if it happens again then we know apple screwed up
0 the macbook air 133 laptop with the m1 chip is excellent with more features than i expected i traded my 2018 macbook air 133 in towards the purchase of my new macbook with the m1 chip ashanti burns at customer service did a good job on getting my 2018 macbook appraised she gave the top value for it ashanti made sure the people in computers found me the macbook i wanted it was a positive and pleasant experience thanks to ashanti
0 wow im going 3 to 4 days now with constant usage between battery charges i am very impressed with the new m1 chip macbook air theres no need in buying the 13 inch macbook pro nowthey have the same processor far and away the best macbook air everhighly recommended
0 wow i got this about an hour ago and it absolutely astounds me signed into the cloud and boom everything there in a few seconds except my 12000 pics of course but they are coming right along this so exceeds my expectations buy buy buy you wont regret it
0 i bought 2018 macbook air but returned it because i was not happy with fan noise it was making plus it had problematic keyboard for early 2020 they changed keyboard but fan noise and thermals were still problematic i am happy to say that late 2020 macbook air with m1 met expections runs cool no fan noise since there is no fan plus it punches above its class weight in perfomance
0 i know its new and i have only had it a day but m1 is legit i bought it worried about software compatibility and was ready to return it should any issues show up but so far all of my software has worked and the thing is zippy pretty much no reason to buy the pro right now with how good the air is
0 hard to believe this is a mesmerizing release nothing is perfect but at this price i think this laptop has achieved value perfection i love the new keyboard i think its a little bit more solid than the early 2020 release the dictation feature is absolutely incredible i am using this feature right now to dictate this portion if anyone actually needed to dictate due to a a physical impairment or poor typing skills this would actually be world changing the snappiness of this system is just a joy to spend time on and the battery life is just a different planet theres never been a combination of solid build good screen great input devices both keyboard and trackpad this level performance all in a sub 3lb package i think leaving home without a charger would be a very reasonable thing with this 18 hour battery life device its like a computer beyond specs i am so impressed and i really didnt think i would ever be impressed again given that im a very jaded tech pro i frankly feel like trading in my 16 pro its heavy its glitchy it runs its battery dry while on sleep half of the time my use case was to have bootcamp on the 16 macbook pro but i am much happier using this for mac nerdiness and then using the surface laptop 3 for windows 10 onthego nerdiness go with the base model lets see what apple comes up with next chrome for m1 came out and it is as solid as ever looking forward to adobe creative suite designed for m1 i installed office 365 and supposedly the beta channel is m1 optimized i have always liked tooling around with keynote pages and numbers and this is no exception on this device phenomenal 10 out of 10 i dont say this lightly or out of ignorance for me this is one of many devices but if i had to choose only one device this might be the one i would go with perfect and i do mean perfect for students the battery life insanity the instant on and off when closing the lid youve never seen a better note taking device between the keyboard and the dictation button it is years ahead of anything else this price point ages so well i suspect resale value on a laptop this perfect will be stout for years to come especially the base model
0 purchased on line and picked it up the next day the best buy app is so easy to use and availability of products is great
0 i brought a macbook air i3 8 gb literally a few days before the m1 came out i was disappointed by how warm my i3 got for doing the slightest bit of tasks and the fan came on and it was a noticeable sound i didnt want to have to worry about fan noise and my mba heating up so i returned my i3 and bought the m1 literally day and night this thing is super fast and powerful and the battery life is amazing no more worries about fan noise or cpu temperature with multiple tabs open i am so happy i switched to the m1 and i highly recommend it to everyone looking for their first macbook purchase or wanting to upgrade from the intel model or any previous model
0 not just an excellent small laptop but an excellent computer in general this doesnt look that strong on paper 8gb of ram some processor made by apple and 256gb of storage this thing is lightyears ahead of anything in its price range i sold my mid 2015 macbook pro 15 for this and it straight dusts my old mac in every situation the screen has accurate color which is nice for photo editing its faster than you can imagine and the battery life is no lie the only meaningful difference between this and the macbook pro 13 with the m1 chip is the cooling fan for the gpu and cpu in sustained loads the macbook pro will do you better due to the fan it keeps the cpu cooler and that allows it to keep its sustained boost clock through the duration of the project so if youre exporting 4k video a lot go with the macbook pro itll save you time if you only do that once in a while save some money and go with this for what its worth a monster of a gaming pc and i still think this thing is fast it really is impressive to say the least
0 this computer is amazing well worth the money no fan super quiet
1 first gaming laptop so i kind of went more for the specs rather than other things like thermals here are the problems youll see 1 thermals are just disgusting 100 degrees c and above from just some light gaming either the laptop will crash and reboot or be throttling hard throughout either way bad for long term dell has to release more updates to fix this 2 there is a nasty stutter i was able to get rid of it by uninstalling most of the dell bloatware included other than that the laptop is zooming if you can take the time to tinker with the thermals there is a guide for it on the interwebs somewhere
1 i bought this laptop because it was on sale and had some addon products overall im pretty pleased with it its a bit clunkier than what i expected but it is my first gaming laptop i purchased online so i went in not knowing how big itd be the fan is the biggest issue i have with it because it kicks on quickly and can be a bit loud making me feel like its going to overheat 2 months in and it hasnt for reference ive only played league on it and it runs well
1 processor and graphics were good but the tiny ssd didnt have enough space left over for modern games like microsoft flight simulator the 8gb of ram also holds it back both of these are easily upgraded if your budget is really tight you would be limited to one game at a time
1 i bought this laptop on the 10th of september and in less than a week i started getting messages on my laptop about there being an issue with the hard drive and it doing forced restarts that i couldnt control it was an open box product but i would have thought that sort of thing would have been looked over before reselling the product i had to send it into dell and i bought the laptop for school so it has been a very inconvenient start to a new ish computer
1 it was working well for streaming before the next gen consoles released but now that the ps5 is out the frame rates r really bad and slow i like it but it needs a better graphics card for next gen consoles and streaming
1 this laptop has alot of power and is fast ive only played world of warcraft on it so far and its been great the fans are so quiet at full speed and i can barely hear them the battery only lasts for 1 hour 30 minutes but thats playing on highest screen brightness
1 with covid19 now being a part of our lives my daughter needed a computer for online learning she started off with an ipad but had to many unresolved issues when i went to look for a computer bestbuy hardly had anything on the shelf due to the demand i have owned many dells over the years and after reading the reviews i chose the g5 for schooling it has a bright screen illuminated keyboard fast response time and i havent had any issues after the first day i did buy a laptop cooling pad but thats it fantastic unit and i would recommend it
1 i bought this for my business needed something powerful but not crazy expensive this fit the bill no complaints other than its a little heavy with the power adapter
1 great gaming pc but would like some more storage the graphics are great but we did have to buy an external hard drive
1 great pc power supply was bad but they replaced it
1 great experience from the greeting to the cashier really enjoyed the time spent finding the right labtop for my gaming needs the staff is no pushy and they know their stuff i will go back and i will spend more money here
1 we thought the service was friendly and helpful are very pleased with are purchase
1 whats a good laptop it only comes with one program for pictures fred to be this expensive it should come with more than just one program
1 my son wanted this so bad i had the option to buy open box or new i took the open box and it was just like a new one i was so impressed my son loves it best buy answered all are question made this convenient im happy i recommend this laptop its one of the best items ive bought thank you best buy 
1 great laptop i actually had to purchase this for work because i needed the speed of the processor and its fantastic ill always look for an open box deal in the future because i got a great machine for a great price
1 my daughter needed to replace her computer as the plug was wearing out on the inside power connection pretty good so far
1 a bit pricey but it was all they had in stocks and i need one asap also i am not a gamer so most of the things are useless to me but no problems so far
1 the computer works well i have not learned to okay the games yet and also the various programs
1 nice computer a bit overpriced but is doing its job for this homeschooling season
1 great for regular use and gaming installed re3 and serious sam 4 as soon as i got it and they ran fine on high settings vr also looks good on it going to upgrade the ram and ssd since it was cheaper to buy the parts than purchase the upgraded version
1 fast delivery bad packaging it was flopping all around in side box no booklets battery was bad  still is 
1 overall great purchase excellent for gaming on laptops performs exactly how i had hoped
1 it really feels like dell needs to get their act together on their drivers and preloaded software fans were running non stop and the noise just made me crazy i would recommend spending more and getting a better quality machine i am super unimpressed dell
1 wow what a difference a great laptop makes less frustration and overall happy customer this computer is super fast and keeps up with workload of pictures social media posting grqphics etc love it
1 the quality of service was excellent as well as the products purchased it is a real pleasure shopping there
1 i love this computer i originally was looking for a computer for school and then i saw this one it was a perfect match i use it for school and gaming
1 great budget gaming laptop for the  but there are some issues im having 1 in chrome and during other random tasks the mouse will start lagging and ill barely be able to move it almost as if the cpu is having random spikes 2 during gameplay of star wars jedi fallen order on medium high settings i got a green screen the audio started making a weird noise and the game was glitching and then crashed and gave me a blue screen and restarted this has happened almost everytime ive played that 3 gets really hot will start throttling your game even with this gpu thats good in it 4 overall its good and fast and the gaming i was expecting out of this was a bit of a letdown it doesnt hold 60 fps on modern titles such as jedi fallen order or metro exodus even if reviews show it does i kinda wanna return this if i keep having issues and build a pc with better thermals and components 36005700x
1 needed a laptop for games and do simple college work camera is good boots up fast and looks amazing with great battery life just overall a good laptop
1 one of the few i mean very few all amd laptops this g5 15 se utilizes amd cpu and gpu also it supports amds smartshift tech meaning it distributes power between the cpu and gpu laptop have a silver pearlescent finish to it a bit on the chunky side exterior is mostly plastic but its fairly sturdy although my complaint with its exterior is how fairly sharp the lip or edges of its panels are which kind of triggers my product designer side it have two cooling fans and plenty of vents which is good since its amd parts runs hotter than intel laptops it offers a decent amount of ports the display is 1080 60hz brightness level of 220nits which not bad since i dont plan on playing too much on this laptop i have my desktop for that or using it outdoors or by a window i wanted this one more for productivity and movies and maybe some gaming on the go lol so full sized chiclet keyboard with number pad and good size touch pad is great the bottom firing stereo speakers are loud as for performance it can handle most games fairly well with the combination of ryzen 5 and rx5600m granted it have proper ventilation or in cold room and proper set up like with a laptop cooling pad you could play games for long period without having it getting too hot some warnings to those who wants to buy this if youre not the type to tinker or you dont have the patience you will have a hard time with this one because it comes with stability issues but if you are its a great value of a laptop out of the box you definitely have to update every driver i mean all especially the bios through windows dell update and dell support assist also it took me some time to tinker with alienware command center to get the right power usage and fan speed when i need it at certain times bottom line its a great laptop for the price i got it for and i am very happy with it
1 dont even bother spending your hard earn money on this laptop you be using it and out of no where you drop frames rate seem like it was a lag at first but it keep happening so i updated everything to the latest drive and seem to continue to have the problem i had read comments about related to this laptop but thought was a bad review or something i very strongly not to get this laptop not worth your 915
2 it took six months for me to research and narrow down my choices to the hp envyx360 the dell xps13 and the lenovo c940 i needed excellent audio above 300 nit display and a large enough deck to rest my palms after almost a month of use i am still super happy with my decision very light to tote around very smart battery saving program and amazing dolby atmos sound shaper i waited for the black friday sale and bought open box excellent and saved a ton of money do not buy the 4k you dont need it the unit is fast bright and works great in tent mode using the touch screen i went from a 17 inch hp to this 14 inch and do not feel any loss buy it and be happy
2 this lenovo was a good computer i really loved i bought again
2 got this for my son as a gift and he loves it the ultraslim compact design and longer battery time give him all the speed and portability that he needs the garaged active digital pen is a nice and unique feature to allow my college artist to draw whenever he feels like to the nvme ssd is definitely super fast fullhd screen despite not being 4k still looks crisp would highly recommend it
2 when i first got my conputer it ran into an error like 5 minutes into set up i let it slide because i thought that was normal but recently it keeps running inti errors and even back ti back sometimes ive contacted lenovo and they havent got back to me idk what to do but other than that i really do love this laptop
2 overall this is a pretty fantastic laptop i use a macbook pro for work but really dont love macos or the complete lack of touch screen or basically any innovation in the mac lineup in a long time my chromebook was hardly able to handle video anymore and overall chromeos just doesnt do what i need it to  particularly with photo editing while on vacations in my search for a laptop i knew i wanted a 2in1 to have the flexibility of a nice large tablet as my nexus 7 is well past the end of its life i wanted touchscreen and an active pen with a garage shockingly the garage feature isnt available on most 2in1 laptops i wanted at least 12gb of ram because websites and modern browsers are hungry these days and that will only get worse i really wanted an amd ryzen 7 chip but unfortunately that never seems to be paired with a bright screen so i had to settle for intel i7  iris graphics my search landed me on the c940 as it has an acceptable amount of ram and ssd storage good processor quality build barely bright enough screen for outdoor use with a high color gamut for photo editing and the garage pen functionality the good  so far ive been impressed with the build quality it feels solid  i like the keyboard feel quite a bit  much more than the shallow travel of the macbook  the touchpad is acceptable though it took me a while to figure out why many clicks kept registering as a right click  turns out the lower right section of the trackpad was set to act as right click by default easy enough to disable that hidden feature  lenovo did a good job of not installing a bunch of spammy demo software ms office might be the worst offender  easy enough to uninstall  i actually find their update and configuration utility useful  lenovos extended warranty and accidental damage protection plans are reasonably priced im impressed with the details theyve put into their customer experience  much improved over my hp days of 10 years or so ago  the laptop has been stable runs relatively cool and quiet most of the time even when the fan is on full speed it isnt terrible  battery life has been impressive  fingerprint scanner has been quick and reliable  much better than my samsung galaxy s9 for instance  i never expect to use a laptops speakers for music but the speakers are shockingly good with mysteriously strong bass if needed in a pinch  physical camera shade the bad  i didnt realize until i started playing around in corel painter  the active pen does not have tilt functionality i didnt realize this was a thing that i wanted until i started actually using the active pen this is quite a disappointment  especially if you intend to use this for digital art creation i can only hope that lenovo offers a tilt pen upgrade that fits in the garage  no usbc charging ports on the right side of the laptop i swear every single place i sit in my house the wall outlet is on the right side of the couch chair table this means crossing the cable over my lap or under me one port on the right would have made all of the difference  doesnt charge with lowerpowered usbc pd chargers this is something the macbook will do  charge with a phone charger slowly sometimes thats all you got and its better than nothing
2 i used a pc up till my daughter suggested that i needed to move into the 21st century and get a laptop im struggling with it too used to a pc i guess its not as bad as i feared and the mouse is actually easier to use than i expected but it took 3 weeks and the tape falling off for me to find the camera i think ill like it more as i adjust to it but my cat sat on it the day after i got it so i guess its a seal of approval
2 the amount of storage is great for the price which is the main reason i bought it i never wanted to see your startup disk is full ever again i use this computer for general use bills shopping and light work for grad school no crazy programs ive had macbooks since 2010 and i will say this is not as nice as a macbook nor is it as nice as microsoft surface 3 laptop my husband has one it is not as sleek or smooth as either if that makes sense but i use windows at work and it made sense to also use it at home as well here are my main gripes coming from using a macbook for 10 years  the track pad is tiring to use on the finger not as slidey as the macbook  the keyboard buttons are a little strangely placed ive had it for almost a month and its still hard for me to type quickly without lots of typos  the webcam is very dark i have to have my screen brightness all the way up in zoom calls so i dont look like im in a cave  the speakers sound like they are in a cave almost or like there is too much bass not as loudclear as a macbook pros  love the finger print unlock  nice and clear display  fast so far  the tabletflip option is kind of cool for having your recipe up while cooking overall i am happy with it it is just going to take some getting used to coming from a mac while the experience of using this laptop isnt as nice as a mac i dont think ill ever go back to a macbook if youre looking for something fast with a nice display and lots of storage i highly recommend
2 my daughter had an older version of this laptopwith this new one she has been incredibly impressed she says the internet works much faster she loves the enhanced graphics backlit keyboard and how smoothly it has operated with microsoft office she calls the battery life amazing saying she has gotten 1012 hours out of every charge she has had no issue with the disappearing mouse that afflicted her last lenovo the sound is good and she likes that it can play 8d audios for reference my daughter is taking college courses requiring her to write many papers create power points and spend a great deal of time on zoom she is a biology major and has had no trouble syncing drawn diagrams papers collaborative works all while having several tabs open for toggling the only thing she hasnt used much is the stylus because she has an ipad she uses procreate and the apple pen on this isnt because it is a superior experience it is just because thats what she was using before we got her this new laptop when she finally gets around to using the stylus i will be happy to add an update to this review we spent many hours comparing laptops before purchasing this one and our finalists were the microsoft surface 3 and macbook pro screen issues at such a high price point helped us to rule out the microsoft and compatibility issues with microsoft software while using apple helped us rule out the macbook over all we have been very satisfied with what this computer is capable of doing at this price point
2 the startup is extremely fast the fingerprint reads instantly and reliably the battery lasts all day i cant say how long really because it has never come close to running out but it clearly has a verrry long battery life it has all the processing speed i could ever want i store all my data in the cloud so after installing all my programs ms office etc the solid state hard drive still has 84 free space the touch screen is fantastic and i like the pen that comes with it i needed a hdmi port which this computer lacks but a 25 usbc adapter from lenovo took care of that be careful i tried another usbc to hdmi adapter from anker which caused an instant blue screen on my new pc save yourself the trouble if you need an hdmi just call lenovo overall i could not be happier with the purchase of the lenovo yoga i highly recommend it
2 i shouldve known better i keep getting reeled in by yoga specs and every time there is some problem from the start this one is no different but this time im returning and not going to bother with geek squad or the mess that is lenovo factory service 1 second time i started up the machine the screen was bright blinding green only thing that made it go away was restarting computer 2 3rd time i tried using machine fingerprint scanner did not recognize me had to use pin to sign in now its a crapshoot each time i try starting the computer sometimes scanner works sometimes it doesnt my fingerprint hasnt changed 3 also 3rd time i started up computer after using pin because fingerprint didnt work the screen was bright redpink this time it reverted back to normal after a minute or so 4 still third time using computer now when i scroll vertically on websites the screen will momentarily turn black this also happened with my yoga 900 5 uncomfortable keyboard surface is too hard after using yoga 900 rubberized board and the edge is really sharp as mentioned in another review my hands feel weirdly overextended or cramped when typing i honestly cant figure out which only that they start to hurt while using this keyboard sound quality is nice speed is good but display problems out of the box is too reminiscent of my yoga 900 and yoga pro 2 not going to deal wit the hassle again tried out a dell xps 2 in 1 today and im going to order one my last dell had almost no issues until the hinge broke all my yogas have been beautiful to look at but too many technical problems and no support at all from lenovo its an awful company returning
2 i bought this laptop as my homework laptop and its been such a pleasant machine to work on opening up the laptop is effortless one finger needed only theres no need to hold down the bottom of the laptop hinges feel well built but dont just go opening and closing the laptop all you want learn to take care of your things life lesson is general keyboard buttons are a a smooth hard plastic its nicely spaced out feedback feels nice sometimes ill just type unnecessary words just so i can enjoy the typing experience it feels that good trackpad is super responsive it also also had multi touch gestures so you can switch between windows and screens you can look up tutorials on youtube the aluminum build makes it feel super premium definitely makes me feel better about typing on it since theres no give unlike those with a plastic build the speakers are great for listening to they can get loud although they lack a bit of bass the 1920x1080p fhd screen is sufficient it also makes the battery last longer throughout your day do you use dropbox lenovo has partnered with dropbox to give you 100gb of storage for 1 year with a purchase of a lenovo laptop this is not a sponsored comment just saying
2 this was the one 13inchish laptop that my collegestudenttobe liked in sidebyside comparisons with the dell xps 13 and hp spectre 13 both of those felt too small for her although there is not a major difference between a 133 and 14 screen but the keyboard on those feels cramped because there is no gutter space on the left and right sides of the keys yes we understand that this is so you can make the body smaller but some people like to have edges at least on the keyboardnobody likes fat screen bezels speaking of which this top bezel bump for the webcam is actually a nice design thing my hp spectre can be awfully hard to open with the beveled edge firm hinge and flush edges so the bump makes it easier to open liked the specs for college use with 12 of ram youre nicely situated between 8 and 16 plenty of speed without paying for it in battery drain my sons dell xps 15 sucks battery life what with the 4k resolution 15 screen size and 16gb of ram and speaking of display this is also great for college students who want battery life for doing work as opposed to skipping homework to do gaming or stream netflix or hulu the hd display is very nice and for normal computer work the tradeoff of 4k for longer battery life was worth it semicomplaint usbc world is just dongle dependent not a fan of it but what can you do love that my 3yearold spectre has plugs for everything but all of the skinny premium 2inones now have far fewer options this lenovo does have one fullsize usb slot though which will be handy real compaint the cursor frequently disappears this seems to be a known problem with lenovo what you do to get it back is put the laptop in tablet mode and then switch it back you can do this physically but you can also use your taskbar lower right my expectation that this will be a firmware fix at some point so id definitely recommend it especially to someone who favors battery life over supersaturated colors that probably arent necessary for most people
2 love the computer and it is easy to set up beware of the sticker that blocks you camera that needs to be removed in order for the camera to work properly for zoom meetings and such only downside is the limited availability for a docking station to pair with it to support a home office environment with multiple screens according to lenova only the thinkpad tunderbolt 3 docking station is compatible and it is quite expensive and ive had issues with my screen staying active and volume control i need to disconnect my computer from the docking station at times to get my second screen to reboot and volume to become active
2 fast seems to handle all my mostly office based apps just fine only issue is that its very hot i even put feet on it to elevate it about 05 off the table and it still runs the fan pretty fast and the underside is hotnot warmto the touch cpu temps look ok so maybe the heat dispersion system just works really well id rather have a hot case than an overheated cpu
2 i wanted to buy microsoft surface there is something about the surface pro that is alluring i am sure many of you know this feeling which is why you are here reading the reviews i bought the lenovo yoga instead because dollar for dollar and feature for feature the yoga wins yes the surface can have i7 processor and more memory but when you configure it as such it ends up costing hundreds more this has the right amount of memory 8gb is good but not good enough you need at least 12gb ssd  512gb minimum i7 processor not really needed but if you have it then you can have more windows open with ease and if you render video the i7 is better than the i5 never settle for i3 i love how slim light and functional it is i love how it can turn into a tablet easily and that it has a stylus built in though it doesnt have hdmi it does have two usbc ports and with an adapter you can connect to hdmi monitors i tested this with an ultrawide and was extremely pleased the speed is phenomenal there doesnt appear to be any bottlenecks the previous years model was reduced to 450 cheaper than this one and i still chose this one due to better battery life faster charging builtin stylus holder the surface doesnt come with a stylus  you have to buy one that was another selling point of the lenovo i have bought lenovo pcs and laptops for years and have loved the brand my work laptop is a lenovo high quality the fingerprint reader makes logging in more secure and faster boot time is ultrafast 3 seconds and i am ready to login sometimes even less quality is handsdown one of the best i looked at dells at the time and there were features or ports that were lacking or they used their stupid looking power adapters one month after buying the lenovo dell decided to start using usbc for their power adapters if you really want to get the best bang for the buck and have a longlasting laptop with excellent battery life and lots of power look at this model as well as dell and microsoft surface pro these three you cant go wrong if you are wanting apple and can wait apple is coming out with a laptop that has the same processor as the ipad that will run mac os as well as ipad apps the laptops will be available end of 2020 you can run windows on the mac by using software called parallels for mac i dont regret my purchase and look forward to a long life with this laptop i have taken it with me on vacation twice once i was traveling in a fiat 124 spider two seater and not much trunk space this laptop is so ultra slim that it was easy to pack i was able to use it to transfer my dash cam video to the local drive with an adapter doesnt have a sd card slot this laptop packs a lot of power in a small slim body you wont regret getting it
2 i thoroughly researched laptop options before choosing this one some of the reasons i chose this laptop include its superior audio quality nice keyboard and its privacy shutter on the webcam i also like that its 14in instead of 13in while i dont use the touch screen feature much it is nice that its available and that the laptop comes with a pen i also appreciate that it has one traditional usb port for my older technology overall i am happy with this laptop i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because i had a brief issue with the display i am working with best buy on this issue
2 this purchase was most need at the time i had a paper due for a class i was taking from duke university and the computer i had been using crashed the salesman was very knowledgeable about this computer and talked me through the capabilities of the laptop the geek squad added the programs i bought with the laptop in a short period of time and had me going very quickly thanks
2 this is a long review for the impatient heres the summary i compared this laptop to the hp spectre 360 13 as they are often cross shopped both are great laptops but in the end i chose to keep the lenovo c940 for its combination of build quality general performance and audio quality like all ultraportables its a laptop with a few compromises but overall its an excellent package now the details first a word about how i use a laptop like this and what im looking for i have a very powerful desktop setup for vr triplescreen gaming and getting real work done and i also have a powerful gaming laptop for more portability in gaming around my house for an ultraportable im looking for a thin light highly portable travel computer that i can use when im away from home that can let me do some work some light gaming and lots of listening to music with excellent battery life like many i initially thought of the lenovo c940 14 the hp spectre 360 13 and the dell xps 2 in 1 13 since the dell doesnt have a usba port and the ssd is soldered down it was immediately out of the running i end up with best buy version of the lenovo c940 on sale for 1099 and the hp spectre 360 13 on sale for 1049 both are the 1080p models i wont go into all the specs since they are easily found on best buys website each of the two had different strengths pros of lenovo c940 better audio 4 speakers louder clearer and with some tweaking also has a wider soundstage larger screen with better contrast deeper blacks but both screens seem similarly bright and id be happy with either maybe slightly better build quality but both laptops have excellent build quality more ram 12gb vs 8 on the hp the highest performance setting is allowed while on battery this is not true of the hp seemingly less throttling on battery vs hp can enable stereo mix useful for recording streaming audio among other things this is not an available option with the hp usb a is normal port without hinge to open completely hps port is partially closed by a hinge that must be pulled down to open the port fully this makes it more difficult to insert with one hand and the hinge like all such hinges seems fragile little to no difference in performance between being plugged in and on battery i consider this particularly important in a socalled ultraportable since i expect to be working or even light gaming on battery much of the time the hp takes a performance hit on battery at least in graphics capability pros of hp spectre smaller footprint and overall size microsd slot a surprising omission on the lenovo given its excellent audio capabilities many people like to keep a loaded card in the slot filled with music andor movies i keep a 256gb card in there loaded with music to play locally via mediamonkey also the microsd slot is spring loaded and an inserted card barely sticks out charges with portable usb type c chargers that wont work with the lenovo likely an amp requirement as the lenovos charger is usb type c my anker 60w portable charger charges the hp with no problem it will not charge the lenovo at all smaller included charger great keyboard more travel than the lenovo and the keycaps themselves have more depth keycaps are also slightly larger than on the lenovo which i prefer multimedia keys ie playpause forward and rewind another surprising omission on the lenovo given its excellent audio capabilities windows hello ir camera not everyone cares about using facial recognition to log in but if you do the hp has it and the lenovo does not when it works its very fast however more than once the camera refused to work properly and i was instead prompted to log in with my pin i also ran a few benchmarks that i had easily available on the two systems see below and in a couple cases i compared to a ryzen 5 2500u vega 8 laptop i own to see how these 10th gen intel chips wiris plus graphics compared to amd vega mobile graphics the lenovo and hp generally feel similar in everyday use though the hp seems to have better graphics performance despite having 8gb ram vs the lenovos 12gb sometimes those extra frames were noticeable when actually gaming but in the end there are things to love about each of these machines and i could happily live with either ultimately i decided that for the extra 50 the overall package of the c940 won out for me the build quality larger and better display extra ram audio quality i love that the audio is good enough that i can leave a bluetoooth speak behind when im traveling now and general performance make this is a nearly perfect ultrabook for me but again i think these are both great laptops and depending on what you valueprioritize most either could be the right choice for laptop testing dirt rally benchmark

2 second c940 which wife bought to replace an hp the first replaced a yoga 2 pro that traveled a bit for 4 years and is now in the garage for youtube diy projects keyboard is a pleasure to use the backlight can be a pain as it dims when not in use so in the dark need to get on the keys for the light to provide guidance fingerprint recognition sometimes does not like your finger and getting to a manual log in takes a bit more time than what i would like overall a good machine that delivers and being able to pull the pen to sign documents has been helpful especially since nothing drives me crazier than fingerprints on screens
2 i did a lot of research before eventually pulling the trigger on buying a laptop i already had a gaming laptop but wanted something lighter for going back to school for my mba the specs on this stack up well against its competitors xps 13 hp spectre macbook air however let me highlight a few key differences 2 usbc ports and a dedicated usb 30 port very convenient for wired or wireless mouse 2in1touchscreen support some people think this is a luxury no one needs but it truly does speed things along also tent mode is very convenient for watching showsvideoconferencing price point is generally lower than the others after thorough research i think this is the best bang for your buck the laptop isnt perfect and ive run into a few issues especially when videoconferencing but none of them are dealbreakers would recommend this laptop to most users
2 i work with creative software like revit lumion autocad photoshop illustrator and others this laptop holds up well when running it hard it is also great to have a touch screen to have more freedom for creating in photoshop and other adobe software i originally bought the yoga c940 with the 12gb storage i definitely believe that the upgrade was worth it considering the type of use that i needed
2 this is a great light weight ultra portable i use this mainly as a secondary laptop to take with me on the go when at home i plug this to an external gpu enclosure and it now turns into a pretty decent gaming laptop i generally get around 89 hrs of on use time with light web browsing with screen dimmed almost all the way down 2nd setting to the lowest the other thing i really like about this laptop is the sound bar that is integrated into its hinge it sounds pretty good around the same sound fidelity as low end bluetooth speakers except a bit lower on the base this is a huge improvement on most laptops i have used in the last 10 years and makes great for a media consumption device a bit of the down side now the screen color is a bit washed out in my opinion i would have liked a bit more saturation and this really noticeable when gaming or watching very colorful media i would have liked one more usbc thunderbolt 3 ports on the right hand side so i dont have to plug in everything on the left however this is done on purpose because they hide a very usable stylus that is charged while inside the laptop on the right side
2 i admit i havent gotten a ton of use from my new computer purchase as ive been saving the heavy use for school when classes resume but i have fiddled with it here and there and everything seems to be working just great the battery life is good not excellent but definitely better than what i had before it runs super quietly which is great my hp elite book was very loud and the fans were running nearly all the time the touch screen is great and the garaged pen is a fantastic bonus im very much enjoying my yoga so far
2 having a middle school child who will be taking online school for the 20202021 school year this computer is great being able to go from traditional laptop to tablet helpsespecially reading for language arts in tablet mode the sound is also great for live learning lessons it may be a little overthetop for many especially when it comes to justifying price but i believe the quality build and features will be worth it in the long run
2 i purchased this for my son to do online schooling we liked it so much and it was so light weight that i ended up going back and buying myself one you can use it in tablet mode its touchscreen and you can use it as a regular laptop the only thing that i have a downfall with is if youre listening to class the speakers arent very loud but overall its a good computer i would definitely recommend it
2 i bought this after a failed attempt with a different brand had it about a month now and i love it the keyboard is very quiet and smooth also backlit for when you cant see well so far processing speed seems top notch love the fingerprint sensor to unlock and then obviously you can flip it so its used as a tablet i havent done that too much but played around a little with it and have no complaints if youre looking for a great laptop for college or work then id definitely recommend this lenovo yoga
2 i bought this machine for my son who is also now doing school online only he likes it because it is good enough from some of his power gaming this is not a gaming machineso dont buy it for that butthe machine is lite easy to move and vastly powerful enough for school tasksand best of all the integrated pen really works for drawing way better than the surface pros did excellent machine
2 i bought this laptop for my daughter who is going to college this year we were looking for something light so it wouldnt weigh a lot in her backpack with long battery life so she wouldnt have to worry about constantly charging it but still super powerful so she can easily make online projects type essays etc this laptop not only can do all these things but it flourishes in all these categories even though she has yet to use this laptop on a college campus this laptop has already powered through all the tasks we threw at it plus the fact that it is super light blows my mind also the integrated pen in the back is perfect for someone that is clumsy or forgetful and will lose a normal stylus
2 absolutely love this laptop so easy to get up and running and has absolutely everything i need live that it folds back into pad mode and love that a stylus comes with it and ticks conveniently in the laptop
2 im a graduate student in engineering and needed a lot of space and good processor to run cad software this computer has been working out great i love going into tablet mode to take notes on my professors powerpoint notes it is super difficult to write with the pen that comes with this computer so i would recommend purchasing the active pen 2 from lenovo
2 bought 2 of these for my kids when they started online school works great for there school work memory is small but everything usually saved on the cloud
2 absolutely best laptop i have ever owned it is super quick and the batt last so long even if im playing a game for a while one of my most prized possessions worth every penny
2 this model replaced my aged yoga 2 and its better in every way snappy light and compact its everything the yoga 2 was but improved went for the 1080 screen because battery life on the yoga 2 with its hd screen wasnt great and got worse as the unit aged no heat issues as are reported for competing hp and dell my only issue was the screen out of the box needed some tweaking sharpness needed a boost and color temp needed to be warmed up a bit easy to do in the intel graphics app and customizing options are essentially limitless a really great machine
2 well for the price and sale i got this on i couldnt really beat this was purchased about two months into the pandemic since the previous laptop i bought from bestbuy had to be sent out for repairs and i never saw it again therefore i was given an in store credit and i chose this due to its compact size and i7 processor along with the gig amount the initial lenovo had to be returned since it kept cutting off and freezing i was given a brand new device and this far it seems to be doing fine
